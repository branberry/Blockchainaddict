## Life Artificer Web Project

For the frontend, I am using React to create the pages.  To get that working, you need NodeJs and NPM
Open a command prompt and cd into the frontend folder and run `npm install` to download dependencies
This project uses sass to style the pages and you must run `npm run watch-css` in a separate command window to modify the .scss files
One more thing you can do is to open up the project up as a desktop app since the application is using electron.  Simply run `electron ./src/main.js`

The backend is using the Django python framework, but as of now needs work before I actually implement anything with it
